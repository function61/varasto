// "Bolt Light ORM", doesn't do much else than persist structs into Bolt..
// this was born because: https://github.com/asdine/storm/issues/222#issuecomment-472791001
//
// Warning: don't Each() and Delete() at the same time. Deletion messes with the iteration
//
//	order somehow, and I observed half of the records was deleted when I tried to delete all.
