TODO: this doc is very much unfinished.

These instructions mainly apply to desktop platforms. Android and iOS devices have
different mechanisms. There are also
[more user friendly mechanisms](../../data-interfaces/)
for accessing data.


OS support
----------

| Component      | Linux | Windows | macOS | Android | iOS |
|----------------|-------|---------|-------|---------|-----|
| Varasto client | ☑   | ☑      | ☑   | Soon    | ☐   |


Setting up
----------

### Download

You'll find the client binary from your Varasto server's UI.


### Installation

=== "Linux/macOS"
	Rename the binary to `sto` and give it executable permissions:

	```console
	$ mv sto_linux-amd64 sto
	$ chmod +x sto
	```

	Place the binary in your PATH.

=== "Windows"
	Place the `sto.exe` in your PATH.

	If you don't know where to put it, put it in `C:\Windows\sto.exe`

This makes it so that you can run `$ sto` from anywhere.


### Configuration

If you haven't configured Varasto client yet, `config print` will give you instructions to fix it:

```console
$ sto config print
file: /home/joonas/.config/varasto/client-config.json
.. does not exist. To configure, run:
    $ sto config init
```

Running `$ sto config init` without any arguments will give you instructions.

You'll find `authToken` under `Web UI > Users > API keys`

After you've run the init command successfully, run the print command again to check config's
validity and what it contains.

!!! tip
	You'll have to change `tls_insecure_skip_validation` to `true`, unless you'll have
	configured a custom SSL certificate.


How does the cloning interface look like?
-----------------------------------------

!!! note
	Currently the cloning interface is only usable from the command line (i.e. nerds only).
	This will be change to a more user friendly GUI in the future and the pushes will be
	on automatic scheduler to make it an actually usable backup method.

Commands (equivalent) from the video:

```console
$ sto clone gu5Yyto9OWE
$ cd "Ender 3 disk"
$ echo "test file content" > Testing.txt
$ sto st
+ Testing.txt

$ sto push
```


Safe removal of collections
---------------------------

`$ sto rm` is a safe method of removing local clones of remote collections - Varasto
doesn't let you remove local copy if it has changes that are not pushed to the remote.

This example continues where we left off at
[movie upload tutorial](../../content/movies/index.md#uploading-your-first-movie).

What happened is that when we pushed the state of the current directory ("local") to a
Varasto collection ("remote"), they synchronized states - i.e. there are now two copies.

Let's try it by changing our local (`ted2/`) directory:

```console
$ echo foobar > hello.txt
$ cd ..
$ sto rm ted2/
Refusing to delete workdir 'ted2/' because it has changes
$ cd ted2/
$ sto st
+ hello.txt
```

Ok let's remove the changed file so we can remove the directory safely:

```console
$ rm hello.txt
$ sto st  # note: no changes are reported below
$ cd ..
$ sto rm ted2/
```


Uploading collections in bulk
-----------------------------

Sometimes you want to upload many collections at once. Instructions are covered in
[TV show upload tutorial](../../content/tvshows/index.md#explaining-the-season-upload-command).
